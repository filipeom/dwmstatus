# Fork of `dwmstatus` written in OCaml

This is a fork of [dwmstatus](https://dwm.suckless.org/dwmstatus/) written in OCaml.
It is a status bar for dwm, which is a dynamic window manager for X.

Currently depends on [ocaml-xlib](https://github.com/filipeom/ocaml-xlib) which
is a binding to the Xlib library.
